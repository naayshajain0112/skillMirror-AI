SkillMirror AI is an AI-powered interview preparation platform designed to analyze how a candidate speaks during mock interviews, not just what they say. The system records a user's response using their microphone and camera, then applies speech analysis and behavioral feedback techniques to evaluate communication quality.
The platform helps users identify nervous speaking patterns, excessive filler words, poor pacing, and lack of clarity. It calculates metrics such as Words Per Minute (WPM), filler word frequency, and speech confidence indicators to provide structured feedback.
SkillMirror AI then generates a “Skill Mirror” dashboard that reflects the user's speaking performance and provides actionable suggestions to improve confidence, clarity, and delivery during interviews.
